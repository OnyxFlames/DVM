#Initial Plans
* To have a turing complete, functional virtual machine.
* To have a small mnemonic compiler built into the VM to allow simple creation of ROMs. (most likely an assembly like language)

#Long Term Goals
* To have a 2D rendering library built into the VM to create simple graphics, load textures/sprites manipulate visuals etc. (using SFML)
* To have a GUI library built in with the ability to attach function hooks or ROMS to buttons etc. to allow the creation of applications within the VM. (using SFGUI)
